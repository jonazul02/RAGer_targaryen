Place pork shoulder, fat side down, on a cutting board with a short end facing you. Holding a long sharp knife about 1""–1 1/2"" above cutting board, make a shallow cut along the entire length of a long side of shoulder. Continue cutting deeper into meat, lifting and unfurling with your free hand, until it lies flat (it’s better to end up with 2–3 even pieces than 1 uneven piece).

Cook cream, butter, brown sugar, and salt in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring occasionally and breaking up sugar as needed, until butter is melted, about 5 minutes.
